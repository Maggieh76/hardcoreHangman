For my final project, I did "Hardcore Hangmnan" in Lua and Love. It actually ended up being more difficult than I expected. 

The first problem I encountered was trying to get my code to read a file and import each line from that file as a word to be randomly picked. However, after working through it for almost two hours with both my TA and Professor Rosen as well as countless hours searching online, I gave up on this idea. I ultimately decided to make a pre-determined list with a preset of about twenty words that the game is randomized between while playing. The other main struggle I had was getting the letters to show up on the screen in the correct order. There was a point where I was getting the letter to show up but once I pressed a new one, the old ones dissapeared. I ended up posting on stack overflow with a few lines looking for help and was pointed in the right direction to switch around some variables and finally was able to fix the problem so my letters showed up on the screen correctly.

I had never used lua before, except during pong, so that resulted in about 50 tabs being open at all times. I did a lot of research on the syntax of the language and connections to love functions so that the game could run as smoothly as possible. However, I feel like I was actually able to learn a lot from this project and I am excited to use lua (and love) in the future to make other games. I spent a lot of time on the lua website, the love website, and stack overflow to just try and understand how the language worked so that I could make my own great game. 

I actually really enjoyed doing this project. It took me a long time since I was starting fresh with barely any experience in the language but once it all worked together it felt amazing. I have been forcing my family to play it for the past few days now and will be continuing to.
